Life is hard oh so hard.

	This will be the day i begin writing about mine. I just watched the Rookie its great.

	Now I am watching A Million Little Things. The first episode broke me. It hits suicide so hard, so painful.

	I am not connected to this show and can pull through. Life is so hard and it's so painful. Life it's so painful. I want to get there.

  It was truly a cleansing experience and I look forward to seeing more
