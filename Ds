Life is hard oh so hard.

	This will be the day i begin writing about mine. I just watched the Rookie its great.

	Now I am watching A Million Little Things. The first episode broke me. It hits suicide so hard, so painful.

	I am not connected to this show and can pull through. Life is so hard and it's so painful. Life it's so painful. I want to get there.

  It was truly a cleansing experience and I look forward to seeing more. I need to see more.

  I messed up again as usual. Thigs are slowly looking better.

	We got bed bugs but while it took 3 more days than expected. I got a day off alone at home and I am truly blessed.
	Ready to go back to work after 3 days of pain stalking labor.
	The hell is over. Today I went back to work. I swear those kids are way too funny for their own good.
	Today I explained to a patron that the movie they wanted to check out was rated R and he told me
		"I ain't scared I am almost 12."

	They are a riot!

	Today was abnormally slow at the library I can't fanthom why.

	running out of time omg.


	It picked up today. The clay event was a win. Camila is so funny tho. Tomorrow Jessie comes to work i must look my best lol

Run run run

	I been working a bit too much lately. Its time to diel back if possible
	A pretty bad headache. I dont know if is the meds lack of coffee or just being old.


	Another day goes by without anything special.
